# Gcode to RML-1 converter
To work with machines from Roland, you need gcode (nc) in the Roland Machines Language (RML-1) format, since I did not find any normal converters (which are convenient to use), I wrote mine in understandable python and converted it to *.exe

The repository helped me during development: https://github.com/akito914/gcode2rml/tree/master
